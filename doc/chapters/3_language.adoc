3. The language
3.1 Statments
ZetScript Language is based on a set of statements formed by values, operators, expressions,
keywords, declarations, expressions, conditionals, integrators and functions.
All statements are separated by semicolons at the end.
Example of four statements,
var op1,op2,res;
op1=5;
op2=6;
res = 5+6;
The last example can be executed within one line,
var op1,op2,res; op1=5; op2=6; res = 5+6;
3.2 Comments
ZetScript support block and line comments.
3.2.1 Block comment
/*
this is a block comment
*/
3.2.2 Line comment
// This is a line comment
3.3 Constants values
ZetScript supports the following constants or literal types,
• boolean
• integer
• float
• string
3.3.1 Boolean type
ZetScript represents boolean value as true or false.
Example,
true // true value
false // false value


3.3.2 Integer type
ZetScript represents integer values within ranges from -(2b-1) to 2b-1-1 where b=32 or 64
it depending whether ZetScript is compiled for 32bits or 64bits. The integer value can
be represented as negative/positive decimal value, hexadecimal or binary format.
Example,
-1; // negative decimal value
10; // positive decimal value
0x1a; // hexadecimal value
01001b; // 0x9 in binary value
3.3.3 Number type
ZetScript represents number value in 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point number. Number
can be represented as integer and decimal form or scientific notation form.
Example,
1.2 // integer and decimal form
2.0e-2 // cientific notation form
3.3.4 String type
ZetScript represents string value within quotes (“”).
Example,
"this is a string"

3.4 Variables
3.4.1 Variable declaration
A variable is a type of container that is used to store a value in it. In ZetScript, a
variable is declared as var keyword.
Example,
var i; // declares i variable
3.4.2 Variable instantiation
A variable is undefined (see 2.5.1) when is declared until is instanced with any value
through operator ‘=’. As an example we can instantiate a variable with integer value
(see section 2.2),
var i=0; // variable v is instancied as integer.
3.4.3 Scope
In ZetScript we have two types of basic scopes.
• Global
• Local
A ZetScript makes easy the concept of global local scope. Basically, variables declared
on the main script are global and the others declared within a block2
, are local.
Example,
var i; // this is a global variable
{ //  block starts here
 var j;//this is a local variable declared inside a block (you can also access to i).
} // block ends here, so the variable j doesn’t exist anymore

2
 A block is a statement that starts with '{' and ends with '}'. 
 
 
 3.5 Built-in types
ZetScript supports the following built-in types
• Undefined
• Null
• Integer
• Number
• Boolean
• String
• Vector
• Structure
• Function
3.5.1 Undefined type
A undefined variable type is the default value that is instanced when any variable is
declared. To instantiate a variable with undefined value assign it typing the undefined
keyword.
var i=undefined;
3.5.2 Null type
A null type is like undefined but in this case it has a null value. To instantiate a variable
with undefined value type undefined keyword.
var i=null;
3.5.3 Integer type
A integer variable type is instanced once a variable instance a integer constant or
integer variable
Example,
var i=10;

Pre/Post variable operations
Pre/Post operations modifies the value of variable itself before/after the variable is
read. Integer variable type has the following pre/post operations,

Operator Expression Description Result
PreIncrement ++variable Performs an increment BEFORE
evaluate the variable
var i=0;
var j=++i; // j=1, i =1
PostIncrement variable++ Performs increment AFTER
evaluate the variable
var i=0;
var j=i++; // j=0; i=1
Predecrement --variable Performs a decrement BEFORE
evaluate the variable
var i=0;
var j=--i; // j=-1; i=-1
Postdecrement variable-- Performs decrement AFTER
evaluate the variable
var i=0;
var j=i--;//j=0;i=-1;
3.5.4 Number type
A number variable type is instanced once a variable instance a number constant or
number variable
Example,
var f=1.5;
Pre/Post variable operations
Pre/Post operations modifies the value of variable itself before/after the variable is
read. Number variable type has the following pre/post operations,

Operator Expression Description Result
PreIncrement ++variable Performs an increment BEFORE
evaluate the variable
var i=0.5;
var j=++i; // j=1.5, i =1.5
PostIncrement variable++ Performs increment AFTER
evaluate the variable
var i=0.5;
var j=i++; // j=0.5; i=1.5
Predecrement --variable Performs a decrement BEFORE
evaluate the variable
var i=0.5;
var j=--i; // j=-0.5; i=-0.5
Postdecrement variable-- Performs decrement AFTER
evaluate the variable
var i=0.5;
var j=i--;//j=0.5;i=-0.5;
3.5.5 Boolean type
A boolean variable type is instanced once a variable instance a boolean constant or
boolean variable
Example,
var b=false;

3.5.6 string type
A integer variable type is instanced once a variable instance a string constant or string
variable
Example,
var s="this is a string";
3.5.7 Vector type
A vector is an special type to store multiple values in a unidimensional array. the
instantiation is done with '[' and ']'.
Example empty vector,
var v=[];
the user can instantiate a vector with values separated by comas.
Example vector instantiated with values,
var v=[1,"string",true,2.0];
If the vector has any value its access is done through integer index.
Example,
var v=[1,"this is a string",true,2.0]; // its has 4 elements where its access [0..3]
print("v:"+v[1]); // v:this is a string. It acces to 2nd element.
Runtime Management
Vector type It has the following functions in order to manage vector at runtime.
Function Description Example
size It returns the number of current elements var v=[1,2];
v.size(); // =2
push Adds value at the end of the vector var v=[1,2];
v.push(3); //v=[1,2,3]
pop Returns the last value and removes it. var v=[1,2];
v.pop(); //=[2], v=[1] 


3.5.8 Structure type
A structure is an special type to store multiple values in a container giving a name per
value so the reference is done through its name instead its index. The instantiation is
done within a block.
Example,
var t={};
Optionally we can init structure with some values.
Example,
var t={
 i:1,
s:"this is a string",
b:true,
f:2.0
};
To acces to its elements is done through the variable name followed by ‘.’ Followed by
the field name.
Example,
print("v:"+t.i); // v:1
print("v:"+t.s); // v:this is a string
print("v:"+t.b); // v:true
print("v:"+t.f); // v:2.0
Runtime Management
Struct type It has the following functions in order to manage struct at runtime.
Function Description Example
size It returns the number of current elements var v=[1,2];
v.size(); // =2
add Adds an attribute var s={};
v.add("a",0); // s={a:0}
remove Remove attribute. var s={a:0};
v.remove("a"); // s={} 

3.5.9 Function object
A function is an object that holds information about a function and is able to call it (see
section 3.8.3 for more information)
Example,
function add(op1, op2){ // function that returns the sum of two vars.
return op1+op2;
}
var fun_obj = add; // stored function add reference to fun_obj
var j=fun_obj(2,3);// calls fun_obj (aka add) function. J=5
Another example by anonymous function,
var fun_obj = function (op1, op2){ // function object that returns the sum of two vars.
return op1+op2;
};
var j=fun_obj(2,3);// calls fun_obj (aka anonymous function). function. J=5

3.6 Operations
ZetScript has the following type of expressions
• Arithmetic operations
• Relational operations
• Logical operations
• Bit operations
3.6.1 Arithmetic expressions
The following operators it does evaluates arithmetic expressions,
Operator Symbol Description Example
Add +
It performs a add operation between two
integer or number values or concatenates
strings with other values
5+10; // = 15
1.5+6; // = 7.5
"string_"+1;// ="string_1"
Subtract -
It performs a sub operation between two
integer or number values
10-5; // = 5
2.5-1;// = 1.5
Multiply * It performs a multiplication between two
integer or number values
10*5; //= 50
1.5*2;//= 3.0
Divide / It performs a division between two integer
or number values
10/2; // = 5
3/2.0 // = 1.5
Modulus % It performs a division between two integer
or number values
3%2; //it results 1
10%2.5; // it results
3.6.2 Relational expressions
The following operators it does evaluates relational expressions,
Operator symbol Description Example
Equal ==
Check whether two values are equal 10==10;// = true
"hello"==”bye”; // = false
Not equal != Check whether two values are not
equal
10!=10; // = false
"hello"!="bye"; // = true
Less than < Checks whether first value is less than
second value
10<20; // = true
20<10; // = false
Greater
than > Checks whether first value is greater
than second value
10>20; // = false
20>10; // = true
Less equal
than <= Checks whether first value is less
equal than second value
10<=10; //= true
11<=10; // = false
Greater
equal than >= Checks whether first value is greater
equal than second value
10>=11; // = false
11>=10; // = true
Instance of instanceof Checks if a value is instance of a type. 0 instanceof int; //= true
"hello" instanceof int;//= false
Note: You cannot mix different types for relational expressions. For example, doing a
relational expression with boolean and integer values is incompatible. 

3.6.3 Logic expressions
Logic expressions are the ones that combines operations through boolean values,
Operator symbol Description Example
Logic And && it performs an AND operation between two
Boolean values
true && true;// = true
true&& false;// = false
Logic Or || It performs an OR operation between two
Boolean values
true||false;// = true
false || false;// = false
Logic Not ! Negates Boolean value !true; // = false
!false; // = true
3.6.4 Binary expressions
Binary expressions are the ones that combines bit operations through integer values,
Operator Symbol Description Example
Binary And & Performs binary AND operation
between two integers
0xa & 0x2; // = 0x2
0xff & 0xf0; // = 0xf0
Binary Or | Performs binary OR operation
between two integers
0xa | 0x5; // = 0xf
0x1 | 0xe; // = 0xf
Binary Xor ^ Performs binary XOR between two
integers
0xa ^ 0xa; // = 0x0
0xa ^ 0x5; // = 0xf
Binary
shift left
<< Performs binary shift left 0x1 << 2; // = 0x4
Binary
shift right
>> Performs binary shift right 0xff >> 1; // = 0x7f
3.6.5 Priority operations
Each operator it has priority of evaluation. ZetScript it has the following operator order
priority,
*,/,%,!=,+,-,^,&,|,<<,>>,==,<=,>=,>,<,||,&&
For example this expression,
2+4*5; // will result 22
You can change the evaluation priority usign parenthesis.
For example,
(2+4)*5; // will result 36 

3.7 Conditionals
A conditional statement are used to perform different actions based on different
conditions. In ZetScript we have the following conditional statement:
• Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
• Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
• Use ternary condition to have a short if/else statement into single statement.
• Use switch to specify manu alternative blocks of code to be executed
3.7.1 The if statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of ZetScript code to be executed if a condition is
true.
Syntax
if(condition){
 //Block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Example,
if(n < 10) {
 print("n < 10");
}
3.7.2 The else statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is
false
Syntax,
if(n < 10) {
 print("n < 10");
}else{
 print("n >= 10");
} 

3.7.3 The if else statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is
false
Syntax,
if(n < 10) {
 print("var n < 10");
}else if(n < 20){
 print("n < 20");
}else{
 print("n >= 20");
}
3.7.4 Ternary condition
Use ternary condition to have a short if/else statement into single statement. It
performs expression if the condition is true or the second expression if the condition is
false.
Syntax
result = (condition)?first expression:2nd expression;
Example,
var j = 0>1? 0:1; // j = 1
3.7.5 Switch
Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
switch(expression) {
 case value_0:
 code block
 break;
 case value_1:
 code block
 break;
 …
 case value_n
 default:
 code block
 break;
}

Example,
switch (n) {//  n is a random integer.
 case 6:
 print("6");
 break;
 case 0:
 print("0");
 break;
 default:
 print("n:"+n);
 break;
}
Switch can have common code blocks in different conditions
Example,
switch (n) { //  n is a random integer.
 case 4:
 case 5:
 print("4 or 5");
 break;
 case 0:
 case 6:
 print("0 or 6");
 break;
 default:
 print("default");
}
3.8 Loops
ZetScript supports the following loop types,
• While Loop
• For Loop
3.8.1The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
while(condition){
 // code block to be executed
}
Example,
var i = 0;
while (i < 5){
 print("The number is "+i);
 i++;
} 

Also it can support Do-While Statement that will always be executed at least once,
even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition
is tested:
do{
// do-while body
} while (condition);
Example,
var i = 0;
do {
 print("The number is "+i);
 i++;
} while (i < 5);
3.8.2 The For Loop
The for loop is often the tool you will use when you want to create a loop.
Syntax,
for(stament1;statment2;statment3){
 // code block to be executed…
}
• Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts. Normally you will use
statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (for example var i = 0).
• Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop.
• Statement 3 is executed each time after the code block has been executed.
Example,
for(var i=0; i < 5; i++) {
 print("The number is "+i);
} 


3.8.3 Functions
Function is a block of code to perform a particular task and is executed when in some
part of the code it calls it.
3.8.4 Function syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name,
followed by parentheses ().
Syntax,
function fun_name(arg1, arg2, ..., argn){
 // code to be executed
}
Example,
function add(op1, op2){
return op1+op2;
}
3.8.5 Call a function
The call of a function is done when in some part of the code it calls it as follow,
Syntax
fun_name(arg1, arg2, arg3,..., argN);
Note: If a function is called with less than N args the rest of arguments will remain
undefined.
Example,
function add(op1,op2){
return op1+op2;
}
var j=add(2,3); // calls add function. j=5

3.8.6 Function object
A function can be stored in variables through its reference,
function add(op1, op2){
return op1+op2;
}
var fun_obj = add; // stored function add reference to fun_obj
var j=fun_obj(2,3);// calls fun_obj (aka add) function. J=5
Also is possible to create function objects,
Syntax
function(arg1, arg2, …, argN){
// code to be executed.
};
Example,
var add=function(op1, op2){
return op1+op2;
};
var j=add(2,5); // j=5

3.9 Class
A class is a type of structure that contains variables and functions that operates with
this variables. A class is defined in ZetScript using keyword class followed by the
name of class. To access class variables within functions use the this keyword in
order to access to variable or functions inside class. In a class we can find member
functions (functions that affects to class variable) or static functions (helper function of
generic purposes about the class type).
Example,
class Test{
 // member variable
 var data1;
 // member function
 function function1 (a){
 this.data1 =a;
 print("function1:"+this.data1);
 return this.data1;
 }
 // static function that performs an add operation between two Test type objects
 function add_test (a,b){
 return a.data1+b.data1;
 }
};

3.9.1 Post add function/variable member
In ZetScrip is possible to add more class member through "::" punctuator.
Example,
// post declaration of variable member
var Test::data2;
// post declaration of function member
function Test::function2(){
 this.data2="a string";
}
3.9.2 Instance class
To instance a class is done through the keyword new
Example,
var t = new Test(); // Instantiate t as Test type.
3.9.3 Accessing to class functions
To access class variables/functions is done through "." operator.
Example,
var i=t.function1(2); // initializes data1 as 2 and return the value
print("data1 is: "+t.data1); // prints value of data1
3.9.4 Constructor
Each time class is instanced, their member variables are undefined.
var t = new Test(); // The a class Test is instanced but data1 and data2 are undefined.
print("data1:"+t.data1); //  prints: “data1:undefined”
The constructor is a function that is invoked automatically and with aim to initialize all
member variables. To the define a constructor we have to define a function member
with same name as the Class.
Example,
class Test{
 var data1;
 // Constructor function
 function Test(){
 this.data1 =10; // instantiate data1 as integer
 }
}
var t = new Test(); // Instantiate t as Test type. Now, member variables are instanced.
print("data1:"+t.data1); //  prints "data1: 10"

3.9.5 Inheritance
ZetScript supports inheritance through ":" punctuator after the name of the class
followed the class name to be extended. The new extended class will inheritance all
variable/functions members from base class.
Example,
class TestExtended: Test{
 var data3;
 function function3(){
 this.data3=this.data1+this.function1(10);
 }
};
3.9.5.1 Call parent functions (super keyword)
The extended class can call parent functions through super keyword.
Example,
class TestExtended: Test{
 var data3;
 function function1(a){
 var t=super(a); // it calls Test::function1(2)
 this.data1+=t; //  Now data1=5+2 = 7
 print("ext function1:"+this.data1);
 return this.data1+a;
 }
 function function3(){
 this.data3=this.data1+this.function1(5);
 print("ext function3:"+this.data3);
 }
};
