Preface
-------

Writing a book these days means, inexorably, offering an electronic
version to your readers.

Over the past few years, I've been trying most typesettings systems out
there, from LaTeX to Pandoc and, finally, Asciidoc, which is the one
I've finally chosen to standardize my documents. It turns out I'm not
the only one, as many large book publishers use Asciidoc these days to
produce their titles.

This template provides a simple starting point for companies and
individuals to create an eBook. Please follow the instructions in the
README.md file to install the required software.

I look forward to read your next bestseller in as many platforms as
possible!

Yolo, January 2015.
