=== Loops

==== The while loop

The _while_ loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

*Syntax*

[source,javascript]
----
while(condition){
	// code block to be executed
}
----

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_while.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,text]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_while_out.txt[]
----

==== do-while loop

The _do-while_ loop is always be executed at least once, even if the condition is _false_, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

*Syntax*

[source,javascript]
----
do{
	// do-while body
} while (condition);
----

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_do_while.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,text]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_do_while_out.txt[]
----

==== The for loop

The _for_ loop performs an iteration with 3 optional statements:

*Syntax*

[source,javascript]
----
for(stament1;statment2;statment3){
	// code block to be executed
}
----

* Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts. Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (for example var i = 0).
* Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop.
* Statement 3 is executed each time after the code block has been executed.

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_for.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,text]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_for_out.txt[]
----


==== The for-in loop

The _for-in_ loop works as for loop but simplifies the iteration over containers like string, object or arrays. On each iteration it can evaluate its value in a variable or its key and its value in a pair of variables,

*Syntax*

[source,javascript]
----
// Evaluate container value per iteration
for(var v in array){
	// code block to be executed
}

// Evaluate container key and value per iteration
for(var k,v in array){
	// code block to be executed
}
----

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_for_in.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,text]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_for_in_out.txt[]
----

==== The break and continue

===== break statement

The _break_ statement is used to jump out of body loop.

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_break.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,txt]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_break_out.txt[]
----


===== continue statement

The _continue_ statement breaks one iteration and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

*Example*

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_continue.zs[]
----

Console output:

[source,txt]
----
include::../examples/the_language/loop/loop_continue_out.txt[]
