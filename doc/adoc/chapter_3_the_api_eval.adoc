=== Evaluation

ZetScript can evaluate scripts from string or from file

==== Evaluation from string

[source,c++]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_string.cpp[]
----

Console output:

[source,txt]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_string_out.txt[]
----


==== Evaluation from file

Having the following script file called `file.zs` with the following content,
[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/file.zs[]
----

Console output:

At the c++ side, to eval `file.zs` file it's done through _evalFile_ function as it shows as it follows,

[source,c++]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_file.cpp[]
----

Console output:

[source,txt]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_file_out.txt[]
----


==== Evaluation options

===== EVAL_OPTION_NO_EXECUTE

In order to eval script but no execute add _EVAL_OPTION_NO_EXECUTE_ option

[source,c++]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_file_option_no_execute.cpp[]
----


===== EVAL_OPTION_PRINT_BYTE_CODE

In order to show byte code for a script add _EVAL_OPTION_PRINT_BYTE_CODE_ option

[source,c++]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_file_option_print_byte_code.cpp[]
----

Console output:

[source,txt]
----
include::../examples/the_api/eval/eval_file_option_print_byte_code_out.txt[]
----

As we can see in the output _EVAL_OPTION_PRINT_BYTE_CODE_ option prints the byte code per each function. At the begin it prints summary,

 - *Function*: Function name
 - *Stack code*: Stack required for code
 - *Stack local vars*: Stack required for local variables
 - *Total stack required*: Total stack required
 - *Scopes*: Total scopes

Apart there's a description per instruction with the following columns,

- *NUM*: Instruction number
- *RS*: Required Stack for current instruction
- *AS*: Acumulated Stack in the current instruction
- *INSTRUCTION*: Byte code and operands if it needs

<<<
Here there's a meaning of each byte code
