== The API

This section aims to explain ZetScript API. It will start explaining the types used in order to interop data native/script code and the main _ScriptEngine_ class as the core of operations in the library. Next sections will be a practical way how evaluate scripts, expose cpp code and types and call script functions from cpp code.
