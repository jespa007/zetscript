I will like to give my sincerely acknowledgment to my girlfriend Maria Portal who
thanks to her I got inspired to do this interesting project and also for the time I needed
she give me the chance to finish it.

Also the authors of many script engines they developed because, thanks to them, I
learned how current scripts works and what actually what people is expecting for a
script engine. This was like a orientation for the development of this project.

Finally to StackOverflow community thanks of this I was able to solve some technical
issues. I hope this community lives eternally whole-hearted!
