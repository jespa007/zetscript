Version: 2.0.0
Date: XX-XX-2018

 
#64 Implement "include" preprocessor feature 
#65 added shared/static link cmake option through -DLINK=[SHARED|STATIC]
#66 Added memory leak detection manager (only for GNU toolchain).  It needs memmanager https://github.org/jespa007/memmanager and pass -DMEMMANAGER parameter on cmake
#67 Compact all utils source in one called CZetScriptUtils
#68 implement try/catch. CZetScript getErrorMsg is not used anymore. catch will return message error and line
#69 Fix memory leaks on delete keyword
#70 concatenate string with return result from variable dot access it gives the function instead of result.
#71 Improve cmake print messages 
#72 post declare variable members it gives "already declared variable error"
#73 fixed return; fails 
#74 vectors are not deallocated if they are initialized on functions and declared as global (may be it has to deallocate on clearGlobalVariables ?)
#75 create vars within for/while scope gives memory leaks and there's no control about nomber of open/close claudators on main function 
#76 Fix print parent variable on access member error
 
#80 initialize vars within class doesn't tell any error or warning 
#81 Fixed final parentesis/claudator lack detector 
#82 Allow "this" do assign or pass parameter as well as any object 

#85,#103 Implement for(..in..)  
#86 Implement access vector element by string 
#87 vector: Fixed error "push" strings into vector 
#88 struct: Fixed fail to find none of its elements 
#89 string as function parameter: Fixed doesn't parse \" within string

#90 for: Support for no pre/conditional and post expressions.
#91 Changed name vector::add by vector::push  
#92 Support for StringVar to const char conversion as parameter into C function 

 
#94 for/while/switch: break support 
#95 for: obligate to put "var" on pre for expression 
#96 for: continue keyword support
#98 removed statment concept 
#99 register C constant feature
#100 Improved virtual machine speed (Improved ~ x1.4) 

#101 Adapt inheritance feature developed on 1.1.3 version
#102 Bug: can use variable before define var itself
#116 CMakeLists: Make permament static link and add -DFCOMPILE

> #103: Reworked parse + compile in one single optimized step 
> #113: Replace try/catch by getError

#114 Turn CZetScript class into helper functions inside zetscript namespace enhancement feature
#115 Rename "zetscript" namespace to "zs"
#117 Make MACROS register_C_XXXX all uppercase 
#119 CEval as eval (all functions are C functions within zs member)
#118 split CZetScriptUtils file in io_utils, path_utils, logger as static function

Other: Lot of clean code up. 

//----------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 30-03-2018


#48 Optimize compile process.
#47 Implement interactive console (zs).
#46 Fixed seg fault on destroy objects in struct.
#49 doing operations of returning values doesnt't work.
#39 Script function and script classes are not clean after call cleancompile
#53 Not do pop scope on returns inside body 
#56 Show only line if file == DEFAULT_FILENAME or not found
#57 it gives "Expected symbol after ','" message on void structs
#54 Memory leaks detection (only for new keywords that involve C class) 
#55 Implement add_attr/remove_attr functions for CStructVariable 
#58 Removed clear compile information on saveState. 
#59 Return undefined on NULL pointers after call C function with value. 
#60 seg fault on calling first a function call and then register a variable
#61 Clean whoke stack array on clean compile  
#62 VM speed improve ~ x2

Added fibonacci test (fib.zs)

//----------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 13-02-2018

#30: ASTNode.h right push/pop pragma.
#31: Configure output library as shared. 
#28: Fixed ciclic dependency in class_C_baseof function on already registered classes.
#34: Added support for unsigned int and intptr_t types. 
#35: Fixed. Bug bad scope index on push/pop ast node 
#36: Fixed. It doesn't register a class if it tries to register some variable base of class that has not registered by base_of_class 
#37: Fixed. When symbols are not found during searching on its linking, it does a memory corruption 
#38: Fixed. Bug double free pointer on set/restore state
#39: Fixed. Script function and script classes are not clean after call cleancompile function.
#41: More detail information about error accessing function "XXXXX" when prints "Expected scriptvar".
#43: Improvement split eval process into parse, compile and execute functions.
#40: Support detection class base of param type in C function calls.
#41: Fixed/Implemented. Due virtual classes changes its memory map at run-time, function and variables cannot ensure the same pointer as base class so
     has been decided to disable heritate all functions/variables from parent classes (only C).
     Due 41, now we have to pass class type on both register_C_FunctionMember/register_C_VariableMember (+1 feature version)
#45: Fixed. Seg. fault on returning wrong C pointer derived class. A helper function has been implemented to return right pointer in function of type parameter.

-Due float it cannot be the same size as the any param of c functions, float type is disable since 1.2. Instead do float *. 
-Fixed. Seg.faults on returning strings * from C functions.
-Check if C function can be registered. C function should be registered at last elements. 
-VM: It prints more information when user wants to access to member function into primitive. Currently it gives the error 
-Support converting pointers C functions if can derive from base class.
-Fixed. Seg.faults on autodelete C pointers given by some C function.
-Fixed. Assignment of C variables of type int/number independent if source script variable is int or number.
-vscript2vector: support for converting elements to numbers (aka floats).

-Removed assign hereritance of runtime stack var on assigment op.
-Fixed. Seg. fault on restore/save states.
-Renamed zg_variable.x to zs_variable.
